        <h4><span style="color: white;">Journalists make a huge impact in their communities every day. From small towns to large cities, watchdog reporting protects society's most vulnerable members, holds the powerful accountable, ensures that public money is being spent the way it's supposed to be, and much more. At IRE, we see the difference that journalists make, whether through in-depth investigations or quick stories that fix a problem or make someone's life better.</span></h4>

      <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 10px;">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel | Deadly Delays</h2>
          <p>When Ellen Gabler's colleague passed along a tip about a newborn whose delayed screening test had resulted in serious medical complications, Gabler glimpsed a larger investigative opportunity. "Obviously this one child's situation was a great story, but we wanted to figure out if this was a problem nationwide," she said. After she spent months negotiating, she had her answer:</p>
          <p>The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel found that tens of thousands of time-sensitive screenings arrived late at labs across the country in 2012, putting babies at risk for complications or death from disorders that are treatable once identified.</p>
          <p>The report had a major impact on the way newborn screenings are handled. "State labs, health departments and hospitals throughout the country have revamped their newborn screening programs and made incredible progress," Gabler said. In Arizona, when the story ran in November 2013, only 67 percent of newborn screening samples made it to the state lab within the recommended three-day time frame. The number climbed to 99 percent just six months later. Other states have made similar gains, and national legislation could be next: The House and Senate have each passed measures to better track the timeliness of screenings.</p>

      <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 10px;">Sarasota Herald-Tribune| Breaking the Banks</h2>
          <p>After exposing widespread real estate fraud in a 2009 report, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune wanted to find the financial backers that made the scam possible. The paper's investigation of Florida banks &ndash; made possible by the discovery of an obscure state law that, after an institution failed, made some of its records public &ndash; found corruption and greed to be the root causes of dozens of bank failures during the recession.</p>
          <p>Working off a data set they compiled to track insider dealing, including who borrowed money and whether or not it was repaid, reporters Anthony Cormier and Michael Braga put together an investigation with serious impact. The series led to three indictments and civil lawsuits and has prompted at least two other federal investigations - both ongoing as of January 2015. "The indictments were a surprise because, up to that point, only one other Florida banker had been arrested for his role in a failed institution," Cormier said.</p>

      <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 10px;">The Center for Investigative Reporting | Female inmates sterilized in California prisons without approval</h2>
          <p>A CNN report on eugenics originally turned Corey Johnson's attention toward forced sterilization of prisoners. After about a week of reading and initial reporting on the topic, Johnson received a tip &ndash; which he later confirmed &ndash; that California prisons had sterilized prisoners as recently as 2010.</p>
          <p>After rounds of information requests and persistent objections to denials, the reporting revealed that from 2006 to 2010 at least 148 female inmates were sterilized without the required state approval.</p>
          <p>A little more than 14 months after the investigation ran, the state of California banned sterilization as a form of birth control for female inmates. A state auditor's report urged further investigation into 17 doctors and eight hospitals involved in 39 specific cases of sterilization. Officials are set to complete their investigations this year.</p>

      <h2 style="text-align: left; padding-left: 10px;">The Virginian-Pilot | Saving for a dog that can help save their daughter</h2>
          <p>"I'd like to say that great sourcing led me to this story," said Kate Wiltrout, "but it was actually the opposite." Wiltrout, the Virginian-Pilot's military editor, noticed a tip about an Ohio non-profit called 4 Paws for Ability that was working with a local Navy family. She did a little digging and learned that the parents of Layla Sawicki, an 18-month-old suffering from constant seizures, were attempting to raise money for a seizure-alert dog.</p>
          <p>With reporters busy on other stories, Wiltrout penned the article herself.</p>
          <p>"I figured the article would spur folks to donate, but the size and speed of the response did surprise me," she said. Emails and donations flooded in. Days after the article ran, the family had raised the $13,000 it needed for the service dog.</p>
          <p>"I thought a lot about why the story struck such a chord, and here's my theory," Wiltrout said. "Readers want to help, and they especially want to help in concrete ways, on behalf of folks who live in their same community."</p>

        <h2>So how do you measure impact?</h2>
            <h3 style="line-height: 180%; padding-bottom: 10px;">Over at The Center for Investigative Reporting, media analyst Lindsay Green-Barber put together a framework for measuring impact. In it, she explains that the CIR breaks down impact, a sometimes tough-to-define buzzword, into three levels: "structural, macro events like changes in laws and policies; meso-level changes such as shifts in public debate; and micro-level changes, like alterations in individuals' knowledge, beliefs or behavior." Below, Green-Barber discusses how to define and measure impact.</h3>
